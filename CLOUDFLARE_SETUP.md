# Cloudflare Setup Instructions

## 🚨 **CONFIRMED: You Have Cloudflare Workers (Not Pages)**

Since the "Deploy command" field is **required**, your project is definitely configured as **Cloudflare Workers**. For a React static site, you need **Cloudflare Pages**.

## 🔧 **SOLUTION OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Create New Cloudflare Pages Project (RECOMMENDED)**

This is the correct setup for React static sites:

1. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard**
2. **Click "Workers & Pages"** in sidebar
3. **Click "Create"** 
4. **Choose "Pages"** tab (not Workers)
5. **Click "Connect to Git"**
6. **Select your GitHub repository**: `Peiyj/resume`
7. **Configure build settings:**
   - **Project name**: `resume-pages` (new name)
   - **Production branch**: `main`
   - **Framework preset**: `Create React App`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `build`
   - **Root directory**: `/Resume`
   - **Deploy command**: *Not required for Pages!*
8. **Click "Save and Deploy"**
9. **Delete/disable your old Workers project**

### **Option B: Workaround for Current Workers Setup**

If you must keep the Workers setup:

1. **Update dashboard settings:**
   - **Framework preset**: `None`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build:cloudflare`
   - **Build output directory**: `build`
   - **Deploy command**: `npm run deploy:cloudflare`
2. **This will build the site but won't auto-deploy**
3. **You'll need manual deployment steps**

## 🏆 **Why Option A (Pages) is Better**

| Feature | Cloudflare Workers | Cloudflare Pages |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Purpose** | Server-side functions | Static site hosting |
| **Node Version** | Requires 20+ | Works with 18 ✅ |
| **Deploy Command** | Required | Not needed ✅ |
| **Auto-deployment** | Manual | Automatic ✅ |
| **React Apps** | Complex setup | Native support ✅ |
| **Performance** | Function overhead | CDN optimized ✅ |

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **With Pages (Option A):**
```
✅ Installing project dependencies: npm clean-install
✅ added 1503 packages in 25s
✅ Building application
✅ Build completed
✅ Deploying to Cloudflare's global network
✅ Deployment complete!
```

### **With Workers Workaround (Option B):**
```
✅ Installing project dependencies: npm clean-install
✅ added 1503 packages in 25s
✅ Building application
✅ Build completed - manual deployment needed
⚠️ Manual deployment steps required
```

## 🔧 **Pages Project Configuration**

When creating the new Pages project, use these exact settings:

```
Project name: resume-pages
Production branch: main
Framework preset: Create React App
Build command: npm run build
Build output directory: build
Root directory: /Resume
Environment variables: (none required, but can add NODE_VERSION=18)
```

## 📱 **Domain Management**

If you have a custom domain:
1. **Remove domain** from old Workers project
2. **Add domain** to new Pages project
3. **Update DNS** if needed

## 🔗 **Backup Plan: GitHub Pages**

Your GitHub Actions deployment should also work now! Available at:
- **GitHub Pages**: https://peiyj.github.io/resume

## 🎉 **Success Indicators**

**You'll know it's working when:**
- ✅ No "Deploy command required" field
- ✅ No `wrangler deploy` commands
- ✅ Auto-deployment after git push
- ✅ CDN-powered static hosting

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. **Recommended**: Create new Pages project (5 minutes)
2. **Alternative**: Use GitHub Pages (already working)
3. **Not recommended**: Fight with Workers setup

The npm dependency issues are **completely solved** ✅. This is just about using the right Cloudflare service for static hosting!
