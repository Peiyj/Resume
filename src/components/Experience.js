      description: "I led a P0 project with 4 engineers, designing and implementing an Allowlist Management Platform for managing near real-time data updating of courses and specializations at the contract-level, saving customer time from 2 weeks to under 10 seconds. Additionally, I developed a RPC microservice with Java and gRPC supporting contract-level allowlist management. Furthermore, I implemented a conflict detection job using Apache Airflow that automatically resolves concurrent updates by the same user based on latest timestamp. Moreover, I launched an internal contract-scope allowlist management software using Retool, saving engineering time from 95 minutes to under 5 seconds. Currently, I lead a team of 3 engineers to design and develop a Badge Management Platform - a stream-processing platform for reliable real-time badge management service providing badge issuance workflow for learners across all organizations, leading to >$10M in contract ACVs.",

      description: "I led a team of 3 engineers to design and develop a Clips Management Platform - a large scale, fault-tolerant, distributed system for clips metadata management service allowing creating, reading, updating, deleting clips metadata across the platform. To achieve scalability, I enabled parallel processing on concurrent, non-conflicting batch clip metadata updates and distributed workload to multiple threads, reducing average clips metadata update time by 80%. Additionally, I implemented distributed Redis Cache to reduce P95 and P99 latency of read operations by 80% and 92% respectively. Furthermore, I enforced data integrity, consistency and isolation for all clips metadata CRUD operations by implementing application level transactions, providing well-defined transaction boundaries for downstream curriculum updating services.",

In this role, I developed a gRPC microservice with 12 APIs to fetch and update contract utilization and learning data, handling ~3K QPS with 98% test coverage. Moreover, I developed a gRPC microservice with 7 APIs to fetch and update learner profiles, handling ~200 QPS with 95% test coverage. Additionally, I implemented the Java migration library with automated double read/write functionality, which was subsequently used in 15 migrations among 4 internal teams.",
