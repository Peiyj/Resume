      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I'm a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong> working at Coursera and a <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> graduate from <strong>Northwestern University</strong>. I have a love for all aspects of <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>applied problem solving</strong> and currently work in Mountain View, CA.</p>
      <p>As a <strong>full stack</strong> software engineer I like to bring together a wide variety of software development experience in order to bring refined, functional, and scalable products to life. I have had the opportunity to hone my skills while working at <strong>large corporations</strong> and various <strong>internships</strong>.</p>
      <p>When I'm not at my computer, I'm probably playing <strong>golf</strong>, <strong>ping pong</strong>, <strong>at the gym</strong>, or <strong>exploring new technologies</strong>.</p>
